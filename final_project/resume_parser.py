    text = """Some economists have responded positively to Bitcoin, including
        Francois R. Velde, senior economist of the Federal Reserve in Chicago
        who described it as an elegant solution to the problem of creating a
        digital currency. In November 2013 Richard Branson announced that
        Virgin Galactic would accept Bitcoin as payment, saying that he had invested
        in Bitcoin and found it fascinating how a whole new global currency
        has been created, encouraging others to also invest in Bitcoin.
        Other economists commenting on Bitcoin have been critical.
        Economist Paul Krugman has suggested that the structure of the currency
        incentivizes hoarding and that its value derives from the expectation that
        others will accept it as payment. Economist Larry Summers has expressed
        a wait and see attitude when it comes to Bitcoin. Nick Colas, a market
        strategist for ConvergEx Group, has remarked on the effect of increasing
        use of Bitcoin and its restricted supply, noting, When incremental
        adoption meets relatively fixed supply, it should be no surprise that
        prices go up. And thatâ€™s exactly what is happening to BTC prices."""
